## How to Add Affirmations

Additional affirmations can be submitted by editing to the affirmations.js file.

The basic object structure of an affirmation in this project is:

```
{
  affirmation:
    "",
  author: ""
}
```

See the affirmationsTemplate.js file for a further example of what should be added to the affirmations array in the affirmations.js file.
